Diabetes Prediction App using ensemble learning model implemented with Go and Flutter.


Diabetes Prediction App
This project is a Diabetes Prediction App developed using an ensemble learning model and implemented with Go for the backend, Flutter for the frontend, and Python for the machine learning model.

Description
The Diabetes Prediction App is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various input features such as pregnancy count, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

The app utilizes an ensemble learning model, which combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy and robustness. The backend is implemented in Go, providing a RESTful API for handling prediction requests. The frontend is built using Flutter, offering a user-friendly interface for inputting data and displaying prediction results. The machine learning model is developed in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.

Key Features
User-friendly interface for entering diabetes-related data
Integration with ensemble learning model for accurate predictions
Secure and efficient communication between frontend and backend using RESTful API
Deployment-ready setup for easy installation and usage
